# Sprite Animation
This is a basic example of sprite animation using JavaScript.<br />
<br />
The unique sprites walk back and forth across the screen (some faster than others) and the user can pick them up with the mouse and drag them anywhere on screen.<br />
<br />
p5.js was implemented to allow funcionality.<br />
<br />
No further updates will be made to this project.
